# This is a Java implementation of a RGB1602 controller class

The RGB 1602 implementation here works with the DF ROBOT RGB 1602 LCD Hat for the Raspberry Pi.  It may work on other LCDs.

PI4J 2+ dependancy - consult the PI4J docs for setting up your RPI for Java.

Remember - don't do what your man here did and wonder why your button events don't work if you didn't put the jumpers in.

Credit https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_RGB1602_RaspberryPi for the Python implementation.


# This is a PI4J v.2 maven project generated by the raspi-maven archetype.
You can look at PI4J v.2 Maven to see how you can use it to push code to your RPI
